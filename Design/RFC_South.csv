See RDP Directive Number 0004
• Contractor is hereby directed to install all LV underground conduit ductbanks that lead to an adjacent Systems Site (i.e.,Traction Power Facility, Train Control Facility, and Stand-Alone Radio Site). The ductbank shall be terminated (capped or plugged and the connection shall allow the future extension of the ductbank) 1 ft beyond the System Site's footprint and install a telltale (e.g.: small PVC pipe) to mark the end of ductbank for future installation reference. Refer to Figure 1.
• Contractor is hereby directed to install one (1) HV manhole and 12 HV underground conduit ductbank (for rail return) that lead to an adjacent Traction Power Facility (main gantry is located inside the Traction Power Facility's footprint). The ductbank shall be terminated (capped or plugged and the connection shall allow the future extension of the ductbank) 1 ft beyond the Traction Power Facility's footprint and install a telltale (e.g.: small PVC pipe) to mark the end of ductbank for future installation reference. Refer to Figure 2.
