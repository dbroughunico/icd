The preferred protection is to locate HSR operating infrastructure at a sufficient distance from passenger and freight (conventional) railroad systems to avoid intrusion.  A lateral distance of 102 feet or greater measured between the closest HSR track centerline (TCL) to conventional railroad right-of-way or property line does not require a phsyical barrier for intrusion protection.

?An earth berm may be constructed directly adjacent to, or in contact with, the high-speed rail embankment only when HSR alignment is on tangent or when BNSF tracks are located on the inside of an HSR horizontal curve (regardless of radius).
• Where BNSF is on the outside of an HSR horizontal curve, the stand-alone berm may be used provided there is sufficient space. It is allowable to reduce the width of the stand-alone earth berm by introducing a retaining wall on the high-speed rail side of the berm.The modified standalone berm shall provide the equivalent resistance to train impact, as demonstrated through calculation as the unmodified stand-alone berm.
